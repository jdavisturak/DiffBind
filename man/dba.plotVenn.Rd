\arguments{

%\subsection{Required arguments}{}

\item{DBA}{
DBA object; if present, only the mask parameter will apply.
}

\item{mask}{
mask or vector of peakset numbers indicating which peaksets to include in Venn diagram. Only 2 or 3 peaksets should be included.  See  \code{\link{dba.mask}}.
Only one of mask or overlaps is used.
}

\item{overlaps}{
overlap record, as computed by  \code{\link{dba.overlap}(Report=DBA_OLAP_PEAKS)}. 
Only one of mask or overlaps is used.
}
%\subsection{Optional/defaulted arguments}{}

  \item{label1}{
label for first peakset in diagram
}
  \item{label2}{
label for second peakset in diagram
}
  \item{label3}{
label for third peakset in diagram
}
  \item{label4}{
label for fourth peakset in diagram
}
  \item{main}{
main title for plot
}
  \item{sub}{
subtitle for plot
}
  \item{contrast}{
contrast number(s) to use for results-based plots. This can be a vector of contrast numbers.  See \code{\link{dba.show}(DBA, bContrast=T)} to get contrast numbers.
}
 \item{method}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, include results from analyses using this method or methods:
\itemize{ 
\item \link{DBA_DESEQ2}
\item \link{DBA_DESEQ2_BLOCK}
\item \link{DBA_EDGER}
\item \link{DBA_EDGER_BLOCK}
\item \link{DBA_ALL_METHODS}
\item \link{DBA_ALL_BLOCK}
\item \link{DBA_ALL_METHODS_BLOCK}
}
}
\item{th}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, use this significance threshold; all sites with FDR (or p-values, see bUsePval) less than or equal to this value will be considered differentially bound (DB). 
}
\item{bUsePval}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, this logical indicates whether to use FDR (FALSE) or p-value (TRUE) for thresholding.
}
\item{bDB}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, this logical indicates that peaksets should include Differentially Bound (DB) sites (respecting the \code{th}, \code{bUsePval}, and \code{fold} parameters).
}
\item{bNotDB}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, this logical indicates that peaksets should include non-Differentially Bound (non-DB) sites (respecting the \code{th}, \code{bUsePval}, and \code{fold} parameters).
}
\item{bAll}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, this logical indicates peaksets combining peaks with both positive and negative fold changes should be included.
}
\item{bGain}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, this logical indicates that peaksets with only positive fold changes should be included.
}
\item{bLoss}{
if \code{contrast} is specified, this logical indicates that peaksets with only negative fold changes should be included.
}

\item{labelAttributes}{
is \code{label}s are not specified, use these attributes to create default labels:
\itemize{ 
\item \link{DBA_ID}
\item \link{DBA_TISSUE}
\item \link{DBA_FACTOR}
\item \link{DBA_CONDITION}
\item \link{DBA_TREATMENT}
\item \link{DBA_REPLICATE}
\item \link{DBA_CONSENSUS}
\item \link{DBA_CALLER}
}
Only specified attributes that differ between peaksets will be used for labels; the ones that have the same value for all peaksets will be used as the default subtitle.
}
%\item{bReturnPeaksets}{
%logical indicating that the peaksets that make up portions of the Venn diagram should be returned. See \code{\link{dba.overlap}}
% for the format of the returned object. 
%If the \code{DataType} parameter is set to \code{\link{DBA_DATA_DBAOBJECT}}, and a \code{contrast} has been spceified, 
% a result-based DBA object will be returned, as described in \code{\link{dba.report}}.
%}
\item{DataType}{
if \code{bReturnPeaksets} is set to \code{TRUE}, the class of object that peaksets should be returned as:
\itemize{
\item \link{DBA_DATA_GRANGES}
\item \link{DBA_DATA_RANGEDDATA}
\item \link{DBA_DATA_FRAME}
}
Can be set as default behavior by setting DBA$config$DataType.

Alternatively, this can be set to:
\itemize{
\item \link{DBA_DATA_DBAOBJECT}
}
to return a results-based DBA object, if a \code{contrast} is specified.
}

}

%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~

\value{
Either a list of peaksets is returned invisibly (as decribed in \code{\link{dba.overlap}}), or, if \code{DataType=DBA_DATA_DBAOBJECT}, a results-based DBA object.

\note{

When working with results overlaps (a least one \code{contrast} is specified), and results-oriented DBA object is generated internally (as decribed in \code{\link{dba.report}}). In some cases, it may be better to generate the DBA object explicitly (using \code{\link{dba.report}} or setting \code{bReturnPeaksets=TRUE} and \code{DataType=DBA_DATA_DBAOBJECT}). This include the case where mseveral plots are being made of the same results set, and it takes a long time to generate the results-based DBA object, as well as the case where there are more than four results peaksets and a mask needs to be specified.
